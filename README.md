## Lanczos Algorithm

The </font><font color='#ff0000'>Lanczos algorithm</font> is a direct algorithm devised by Cornelius Lanczos that is an adaptation of power methods to find the *m* "most useful" (tending towards extreme highest/lowest) eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an *n x n* Hermitian matrix, where *m* is often but not necessarily much smaller than *n*.
