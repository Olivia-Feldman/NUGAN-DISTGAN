## Lanczos Algorithm

The Lanczos algorithm is a direct algorithm devised by Cornelius Lanczos that is an adaptation of power methods to find the {\displaystyle m}m "most useful" (tending towards extreme highest/lowest) eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an {\displaystyle n\times n}n\times n Hermitian matrix, where {\displaystyle m}m is often but not necessarily much smaller than {\displaystyle n}n.
